# Project 1: NLP Amazon Food Reviews: Project Overview (Python)
* Creates a Naive Bayes sentiment analysis model to help Amazon vendors better understand the granularity of reviews. 
* Manually labeled and pre-processed over 4,000 records to train the initial model, lowercasing, removing punctuation, removing stopwords, and stemming words. 
* Allowed for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams and then analyzed feature importance using a logistic regression.
