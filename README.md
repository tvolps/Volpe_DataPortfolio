# [Project 1: NLP Amazon Food Reviews: Project Overview (Python)](https://github.com/tvolps/Volpe_NLP_Amazon)
* Creates a Naive Bayes sentiment analysis model (and other models) to help Amazon vendors better understand the granularity of reviews. 
* Manually labeled and pre-processed over 4,000 records to train the initial model, lowercasing, removing punctuation, removing stopwords, and stemming words. 
* Allowed for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams and then analyzed feature importance using a logistic regression.

# [Project 2: Restaurant Discounting Binary Outcome (R)](https://github.com/tvolps/DiscountingProjectVolpe-R-)
* Uses roughly 1,000 results from a randomly generated survey to find the probability that an individual would go to a restaurant
* Uses a subset of the data to determine what the probability is someone would change their mind from no to yes given a random discount
* Creates a logistic regression, KNN, naive bayes, decision tree, and neural network

# [Project 3: Tableau Visualizations / Public Profile (Tableau)[https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/trevor.volpe]
* Contains a handful of visualizations created through MIS 561 coursework
